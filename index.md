### Why Microsoft Word Must Die
This is a blog post-turned discussion board explaining the conception of Microsoft Word and its programming errors. Stross points out that there was, in fact, a time before Word where several companies competed for the market, which lead to greater innovation in the field. Then Steve Jobs asked Bill Gates to create software for Macintosh computers. The author believes that one fatal flaw in the creation of this software was deciding to use both control codes and hierarchical style sheets, which the he points out are incompatible. Then a brief explanation of how Microsoft achieved monopoly in this field. Their strategy was to acquire smaller companies that created things like, spell checkers, grammar checkers, among others, and integrate those programs into Word which stopped competition and, therefore, innovation. 

### Markdown: Markup that's Downright Simple
Markdown is a markup language, created in 2004 by John Gruber, that allows text to be read in several formats like HTML and XHTML. Doctor Evia explains how Markdown can be used to create ready to use documents with less lines of commands when compared to other systems. A section of this article emphasizes Markdowns deliberately simple design which consultant, Don Day agrees with. Evia then demonstrates a line of code in HTML and compares it to the much shorter and simpler Markdown version. However, Markdown is primarily for text content, not graphics which would need further processing. Both Day and Evia agree that plain text formatting is here to stay and that other companies will pick it up in the future.

## Quotes

### Please Stop Sending Me Your Shitty Words Documents
> Firstly you assume that I have Word or some clone of it installed. I know you think the words 'Computer', 'Microsoft', 'Windows' and 'Office' are synonymous, but they're not and there are plenty of people in the world who use *nix operating systems. By sending me a .docx file you're forcing me to find a work around, so that I can use your document.

### Why Microsoft Word Must Die
> The reason I want Word to die is that until it does, it is unavoidable.

> But one by one, Microsoft moved into each sector and built one of the competitors into Word, thereby killing the competition and stifling innovation. Microsoft killed the outline processor on Windows; stalled development of the grammar checking tool, stifled spelling checkers.

### Markdown: Markup that's Downright Simple
>“Markdown is for textual content. If an author is also in charge of graphic design, page layout, or multimodal content, then the Markdown text needs a second or even third layer of processing to be ready for end users,” says Evia. “Fortunately, there are many commercial and open source applications that take care of some of those steps, but there is frequently some heavy author work behind a final product that was built with pure Markdown.”

### Guide to Podcasting
Universial Podcasts:
> While universal podcasts often use a blend of revenue streams (such as direct support and foundation grants), they rely quite heavily on both baked-in and dynamic advertising. Summing up this philosophy, van Mosel said, “We’re platform agnostic. We’ll send our content everywhere. We want as many people to be touched by our content as possible, because our ads travel through wherever it goes. It works for us—more adoption, more exposure, more opportunity.

Premium Podcasts:  
> These podcasts and networks seek to cultivate relationships with their audiences and create more “premium” experiences. While podcasts may be freely accessible in order to grow listenership, listeners are encouraged to support the content makers via direct donations or a subscription model. Panoply’s Andy Bowers noted that, in his experience, podcast listeners are among the most likely to convert into subscribers. Subscribers are given preferential treatment in terms of content, merchandise, access to events, etc. “The majority of people who join [Slate Plus] are podcast listeners. They get VIP tickets to live shows and come to meet the hosts. They’re their hardcore fans,” he said.
